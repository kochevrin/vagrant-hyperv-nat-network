# Deploying Virtual Machines on Hyper-V Using Vagrant with a NAT Network

‚ùó Change variables in the `.env` to meet your requirements.

üí° Note that the `.env` file should be in the same directory as `Vagrantfile`.

To work with this project, you need to install the required Vagrant plugins

and generate SSH keys, or use the project's provided keys.

## Vagrant Plugin Installation

Install necessary Vagrant plugins

`vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload`

`vagrant plugin install dotenv`

Start Vagrant with the Hyper-V provider
`vagrant up --provider=hyperv`

Destroy the Vagrant environment
`vagrant destroy`

## SSH 

By default, the SSH key from the project's `ssh_keys` directory is distributed to the machines.
To connect, you need to copy the private key to your user's directory on the connecting machine or generate a new key following the instructions below.
Add the public key to the `ssh_keys` folder in the project and update the `SSH_KEY_PATH=./ssh_keys/id_rsa.pub` variable in the `.env` file.

### Generating an SSH Key

#### PowerShell

1. **Generate a new SSH key pair**

Replace "my_key" with your preferred key name.

`$sshKeyPath = "$env:USERPROFILE/.ssh/my_key"`

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f $sshKeyPath`

Set the path to the public key in the `.env` file


#### Bash

2. **Generate a new SSH key pair**

Replace "my_key" with your preferred key name.

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f "$HOME/.ssh/my_key"`

Set the path to the public key in the `.env` file
